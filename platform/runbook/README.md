# Platform Runbook

This directory is dedicated to the platform operations runbook.

## Overview

A [runbook](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.runbook.en.html) is a well documented set of procedures 
to achieve specific outcomes. Often it coincides with a playbook for incident management. Here we propose 
to establish a clear list of operations, known failure modes and success cases we expect. By doing so 
we make it easy for anyone to operate the platform.
